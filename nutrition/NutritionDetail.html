              First, it’s important to understand that the immune system is a
              system, not a single entity, and according to Science Direct, it’s
              “arguably the most complex system in the human body.”(Ref)

                    The innate immune system is inherited and is active from the
                    moment you were born. It provides a physical barrier to
                    protect your body and includes your skin, the eye’s cornea,
                    and the mucous membrane that lines your respiratory,
                    gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. These barriers
                    protect against harmful invaders, and when this system
                    recognizes an invader, it goes into action right away by
                    surrounding, covering, and eliminating the invader.

                Your acquired immune system, also called the adaptive immune
                system, with help from your innate system, makes cells
                (antibodies) to protect your body from invaders. These
                antibodies develop after you’ve been exposed to the invader and
                stay in your body. Acquired immunity creates immunological
                memory; for example, if you’ve had measles, the acquired
                immunity is life-long – you’ll never get measles again. In other
                cases, as with chickenpox, you don’t get lifetime immunity, but
                after your first exposure, your immune system will recognize the
                invader and defend against it. Your acquired immune system
                changes during your life. There’s a normal age‐related decline
                in immune functions, referred to as immunosenescence, which
                explains why older people are more prone to get sick and
                experience diseases more severely. (Ref) It’s also why vaccines
                don’t work as well in elderly people. (Ref)

                It makes sense that if you’re looking to boost your immune

                possible. Remember that your immune system is a system, and
                every part of your body functions better when you adopt healthy

              You’ve heard the phrase “garbage in, garbage out,” right? That
              applies to your immune system. If you want your immune system to
              work well, you need to provide it with good, regular nourishment.
              A diet of fresh, whole foods with an emphasis on fresh vegetables
              and fruits is ideal. The bottom line is that there is a
              correlation between strong immune systems and a good diet. As an
              example, scientists have long understood that people who live in
              poverty and are malnourished are more vulnerable to infectious
              diseases.<br />
              As we get older it’s even more important to focus on good
              nutrition. As we age, we burn fewer calories, but our nutrient
              needs are the same or even higher than when we were younger. It’s
              therefore important to focus on choosing foods that are as
              nutrient-dense as possible. <br />
              When we eat healthy food, we become healthy, and if our goal is to
              optimize our health and boost our immunity, optimal nutrition is
              key. Optimal nutrition, superior health and a strong immune system
              come from a diet focused on nutrient-rich foods and fewer
              calorie-rich foods. Therefore, the foundation of a nutrition plan
              designed to boost health and immunity consists of nutrient-dense
              foods. <br />

              This means focusing on high-nutrient, natural plant foods:
              vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, and seeds. Additionally, if it’s
              possible, choose organic foods, as organic fruits and vegetables
              deliver 20-40% more antioxidants than conventional fruits and
              vegetables. (Ref) At the same time, it’s important to reduce or
              eliminate foods with low nutrients and foods that are actually
              toxic to the body. <br />
              If you’re like most people, you probably don’t eat enough
              vegetables to benefit your health and immune system. Maybe
              considering the current COVID-19 situation, it’s time to change
              that – especially considering the evidence that a diet focused
              primarily on consuming vegetables and fruits is the most important
              factor in preventing chronic disease and premature death. (Ref 1,
              2)

              Over 2500 years ago Hippocrates said, “All disease begins in the
              gut.” Only in the last 20 years or so has research revealed how
              correct Hippocrates was. Gut health is critical to overall health.
              An unhealthy gut contributes to a weakened immune system and
              diseases including diabetes, obesity, depression, and chronic
              fatigue syndrome. (Ref 1, 2, 3) On the other hand, brain health is
              associated with having a healthy gut. <br />
              The research also shows that the longest living people have very
              diverse gut microbiomes (the trillions of bacteria and other
              organisms living in and on us). (Ref) <br />
              Consider this: your gut microbiome contains between one trillion
              and ten trillion cells, and an adult person’s body has about one
              trillion cells. So, we are at least as much bacterial as we are
              human. <br />
              Your gut microbiome comprises more than 75 percent of your immune
              system, and there are several things people commonly do that harm
              the gut microbiome, including:

                    A major task of your intestine is to form a defensive
                    barrier to prevent absorption of damaging substances from

            <p class="t-c-p mt-4">
              Fruits and vegetables contain lots of antioxidants, which are
              vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that help your body both
              remove free radicals and control free-radical production. <br />
              Free radicals are generated both by our bodies and by exposure to
              X-rays, ozone, cigarette smoke, air pollutants, and industrial
              chemicals. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is
              necessary for our bodies to function properly. If free radicals
              overwhelm your body’s ability to regulate them, a condition known
              as oxidative stress ensues, which triggers a number of diseases.
              <br />
              Most of the degenerative diseases that afflict humanity are
              related to free radical reactions. These diseases include
              atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory joint disease, asthma,
              diabetes, senile dementia and degenerative eye disease. (Ref)
              <br />
              It’s because of this potential for free radicals to cause harm
              that including antioxidants in our diets is so important, since
              antioxidants assist our bodies in coping with oxidative stress.
              This approach of consuming dietary antioxidants as functional
              foods is critical for managing diseases, since antioxidants are
              the natural enemies of free radicals. <br />
              That said, free radicals are not all bad and can help our immune
              cells and remove damaged cells. The problem with free radicals is
              that without regular consumption of antioxidants and
              phytochemicals to keep them in check, they begin to destroy normal
              tissue. <br />
              Not getting enough antioxidants can lead to an excess of free
              radicals, which creates inflammation and leads to premature aging.
              Vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, selenium, and alpha-and
              beta-carotene, as well as various other phytochemicals, have
              antioxidant effects. The most important sources of natural
              antioxidants come from routinely consuming vegetables and fruits,
              beans, nuts and seeds.
              <br />
              Vegetables are especially rich in antioxidants. Eating lots of
              vegetables - especially green vegetables - is an easy way to get
              lots of antioxidants into your diet. Antioxidants are minimal from
              animal products, and absent in processed foods.

              Lots of supplements claim to boost our immune system, but the
              problem is that proving that an herb—or any substance, for that

              due to the complexity of the immune system. <br />
              What we do know for sure is that a deficiency in certain minerals
              and antioxidants can impair your immune system. It is precisely
              for that reason that the best thing you can do for yourself is to
              adopt a diet consisting of organic, fresh whole foods, and mostly
              vegetables and fruits. By doing so, you’ll be getting most of the
              compounds our bodies need. That said, it doesn’t hurt to
              supplement with a multi-vitamin. <br />

              How Does Exercise Support Your Immune System?
            </h1>
            <p class="t-c-p mt-4">
              “Being active has enormous health and well-being benefits.
              Physical activity is important in the management of long-term
              diseases, but, it is even more important in the prevention of many
              other common diseases. I believe that if physical activity was a
              drug it would be classed as a wonder drug, which is why I would
              encourage everyone to get up and be active.” <br />
              -Professor Dame Sue Bailey, Chair of the Academy of Medical Royal
              Colleges (AOMC), in the Forward to the AOMC’s report on exercise:
              (Ref) <br />
              Everyone knows that regular exercise is important for healthy
              living, and it’s not new information: over 2300 years ago,
              Aristotle said that “a man falls into ill-health as a result of
              not caring for exercise.” Exercise improves cardiovascular health,
              lowers blood pressure, helps control body weight, and protects
              against a variety of diseases. Exercise also contributes to
              general good health and to a healthy immune system by promoting
              good circulation, which allows the cells and substances of the
              immune system to move through the body freely and do their job
              efficiently. <br />
              The amount and type of physical activity you get is related to
              your health and the strength of your immune system. Virtually all
              the global health organizations agree that everybody should get at
              least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, like a brisk walk,
              every day. You can mix it up by doing your 30 minutes as 3
              10-minute walks but exercising in at least 10-minute blocks is
              recommended – it’s not considered enough to just walk a few
              minutes. (Ref 1, 2, 3) <br />
              The protective effect of regular moderate exercise is significant
              – there’s a 40-50% reduction in the number of days people are
              sick, and exercise can reduce the risk and severity of respiratory
              viral infection. (Ref) <br />
              Studies show that exercise boosts our immune systems, and that
              moderate exercise is best. (Ref 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Heavy exertion
              lasting longer than 90 minutes should be avoided. (Ref 1, 2) The
              takeaway is that it’s important to exercise enough to build your
              immune system, but too much exercise can actually reduce your
              immune function, as it stresses your body. As figure 1, Optimal
              Exercise shows, regular moderate intensity exercise improves the
              immune response to respiratory viral infections. <br />
            </p>
            <p class="mt56 t-c-p">
              It’s also important to diversify your physical activity to include
              aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. (Ref 1, 2, 3) As we get
              older, including balance into your fitness routine is also
              important, not so much as it relates to immunity, but to prevent
              falls as we age. (Ref) <br />
              To get an idea of what types of exercise you should make a regular
              part of your lifestyle, see the activity pyramid below (figure 2).
              The activities at the base of the pyramid should be done daily,
              and as you go up the pyramid, the activities are less frequent but
              more intense. <br />
              If you’re presently inactive, start with the activities at the
              base, and as you get stronger and more fit, move up the pyramid.
              Activities higher up in the pyramid produce many benefits in your
              aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. <br />
              There are a few things you can take into consideration, which
              should be common sense. For example, you can replace daily
              moderate exercise with running 20-30 minutes, 3 to 4 times per
              week. The same amount of energy is expended in these two examples,
              so the health benefits are considered to be the same. <br />
              That being said, regular movement is advised – you’ve heard the
              phrase “sitting is the new smoking.” The more regular movement you
              get, the better off you are. <br />
              Studies also show a correlation between regular exercise and
              longevity (Ref 1, 2), but it’s important to note that a moderate
              amount of exercise provides the benefits: too much exercise, or
              none at all, both aren’t good for you. With jogging, for example,
              between 1 and 2.5 hours per week at a slow to moderate pace, 2 or
              3 times per week brings the greatest health and longevity
              benefits. <br />
              The ideal amount of exercise to promote longevity is between 7-12
              hours of exercise per week (Ref 1, 2). Dr. Valter Longo, one of
              the world’s leading experts on longevity, recommends: <br />

            <ul class="t-c-p">
              <li>An hour of fast walking every day</li>
              <li>
                At least medium intensity cardiovascular exercise 2.5-5 hours
                per week
              </li>
              <li>Resistance training at least 2 times per week</li>
            </ul>

                    Physically active individuals run half the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease as sedentary persons of the same age. Physical activity also decreases the risk of having high blood pressure, age-related diabetes and colon cancer. Quality of life is also improved by physical activity due to greater mental well-being and better physical health. There is also strong support for physically active individuals having a lower risk of being affected by brittle bones, bone fractures caused by falls, blood clots, obesity, and mental disorders. <br>

              Lots of supplements claim to boost our immune system, but the problem is that proving that an herb—or any substance, for that matter—can enhance immunity is very complicated. This is in part due to the complexity of the immune system. <br>
What we do know for sure is that a deficiency in certain minerals and antioxidants can impair your immune system. It is precisely for that reason that the best thing you can do for yourself is to adopt a diet consisting of organic, fresh whole foods, and mostly vegetables and fruits. By doing so, you’ll be getting most of the compounds our bodies need. That said, it doesn’t hurt to supplement with a multi-vitamin. <br>
Scientists don't know, for example, whether an herb that seems to raise the levels of antibodies in the blood is actually doing anything beneficial for overall immunity.

            <p class="t-c-p mt-4">
              We’ve all heard the phrase “laughter is the best medicine,” and it turns out that there’s at least some truth to this notion. Laughter literally triggers healthy physical and emotional changes in your body, strengthening your immune system, improving your mood, and reducing or eliminating your stress. <br>
At an intuitive level, this makes sense. The effects of humor and laughter are numerous: Humor is not only instinctive and a basic human need, but it also is very good medicine. Laughter boosts the immune system, lowers blood pressure, reduces stress hormones, and is linked to healthy functioning organs. (Ref 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

              We trust that this article has provided you with things you can do to boost your immune system. Does that mean you won’t get sick? Are there any guarantees? Of course not. COVID-19 is a new and terrible virus. What you can take away from this article is that there are a number of things you can do to boost your immune system that are in your control, and if your immune system is functioning even a little better, you might be better able to recover in the unfortunate case that you do get sick.
